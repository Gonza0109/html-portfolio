<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Gonzalo Zegarra, I'm a high school graduate that is looking to get more involved in programming. 
  I like trying new things and by coding I can find a little spark that is lighting a little bit more every single
  step in my ladder of knowledge. </p>

<p> I like to play videogames and to spend time with the people i care, I'm a very friendly and honest being.
   Also I'm a big fan of music and it helped me become a music lover. Really a big fan of animals like dogs, cats or rabbits. 
   If you would like to give me shot or contact me, please don't hesitate to do so. I would be happy to talk to you. </p>
