<h1>The Best Movies According to Gonzalo</h1>

<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3> Hereditary </h3>
<h4> This is my favourite horror film. I love the tiny details in the film and big gaps of suspense in it.</h4>

<h3> V/H/S 94 </h3>
<h4> My favourite found footage movie, the trama is something really weird but it's really good.</h4>

<h3> Interestellar </h3>
<h4> Really good space movie that plays with your emotions. </h4>
